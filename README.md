# Big-Data-Project-with-SQL

**Introduction:**

* In this project, I used a public data set, the Airline On-Time Statistics and Delay Causes data set, published by the United States Department of Transportation at http://www.transtats.bts.gov/. The On-Time Performance dataset records flights by date, airline, originating airport, destination airport, and many other flight details. Data is available for flights since 1987. I used the data to calculate statistics such as the percent of flights that depart or arrive on time by origin, destination, and airline.

**Goals of the project:**

1. Get experience to work with real data
2. Perform main data related tasks: explore the data, create schema, load the data, analyze the data using SQL.
3. Look up for required technical information in the external sources â€“ manuals and internet at large.
